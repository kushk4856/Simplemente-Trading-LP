                        <p>Hypothetical Performance Disclosure: Hypothetical performance results have many inherent
                          limitations, some of which are described below. no representation is being made that any
                          account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown; in fact, there
                          are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual
                          results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of
                          hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of
                          hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no
                          hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk of actual
                          trading. for example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading
                          program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual
                          trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the
                          implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the
                          preparation of hypothetical performance results and all which can adversely affect trading

                          Futures and forex trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor. An investor
                          could potentially lose all or more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can
                          be lost without jeopardizing one's financial security or lifestyle. Only risk capital should
                          be used for trading, and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Past

                        <p>Hypothetical Results Statement:</p>
                        <p>Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described
                          below. No representation should be made that any account will or is likely to perform
                          similarly to those shown; in fact, there are frequent differences between hypothetical results
                          and the actual results obtained by any trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical
                          performance results is the fact that they are prepared with hindsight. Furthermore,
                          hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can
                          take into account the financial risk of actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand
                          losses or to adhere to a particular trading program regardless of losses are material points
                          which can substantially affect actual trading results. There are many factors relating to the
                          markets in general, or to the implementation of any specific trading program, all of which
                          cannot be considered in the preparation of hypothetical results, all of which may adversely
                          affect trading results.</p>

                        <p>1. Service providers will be able to use storage and data recovery devices on the

                          Whenever technically possible and effective, the recipient’s consent to accept data treatment
                          will be given via the parameters in the browser or other applications, provided that the

                          The foregoing shall not prevent the possible technical storage or access for the sole purpose
                          of transmitting communication via

                          As specified on the “Guide on cookie use” published by the Spanish Data
                          Protection Agency (AEPD) in the year 2013, LSSI-CCE applies to any type of file or device

                        <p>
                          A cookie is a file or device which is downloaded to your computer when accessing certain
                          websites. In addition to other tasks, cookies allow a webpage to store and recover information
                          on a user’s browsing habit or equipment, and can be used to recognize
                          the user, depending on the information contained and how these cookies use your computer.
                          As stated on the “Guide on the use of cookies” published by AEPD, depending on the finality of
                          data obtained from cookies we can classify the different
                          types of cookies as follows:
                        </p>
                        <p>– Technical cookies: these are cookies that enable the user to browse the webpage, platform
                          or application and use the different options or service therein available, such as controlling
                          the traffic and data communication,
                          identifying the session, accessing restricted website areas, remembering elements that compose
                          an order, using security elements during browsing, storing content to broadcast videos or
                          sound or sharing content over the social networks.</p>
                        <p>– Customization
                          cookies: these are cookies that enable the user to access the service with some general
                          pre-defined features in accordance to some terminal criteria such as the language, the type of
                          browser used to access the service, the regional configuration with
                          information on where the user accesses the service, etc.</p>
                        <p>– Analytical cookies: these are cookies that enable the party responsible to track and
                          analyze the user’s behaviour on the websites linked to them. The information gathered by such
                          cookies
                          is used to measure the activity of the websites, applications or platforms and to create user
                          browsing profiles on those websites, applications and platforms in order to introduce
                          improvements on the function of the analysis of usage data created
                          by the service’s users.</p>
                        <p>– Advertising cookies: these are cookies that allow, in the most effective way possible, the
                          management of the advertising space that the editor may have included on a website,
                          application or platform used to provide the
                          requested service, based on criteria such as edited content or frequency of the adverts
                          displayed.</p>
                        <p>– Behavioral advertising cookies: these are cookies that allow, in the most effective way
                          possible, the management of the available advertising
                          spaces which the editor may have included on a website, application or platform used to
                          provide the requested service. These cookies store information on user behaviour obtained from
                          continued observation of their browsing habits, thus making it possible
                          to develop a specific profile to show advertising that is consistent with this behavior.</p>
